My thesis work revolves around applying social constructivist theories in the world of adaptive learning. With this work, I aim to develop adaptive learning systems that not only account for student performance but also further the goal of social learning as described by Bandura. This should be useful in the context of online learning both as motivation as well as for improved learning.
