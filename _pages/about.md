As a Bullard Research Fellow at the [University of Texas at Austin’s iSchool](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/), I explore the ethical and human-centered design of AI systems, with a particular focus on explainability, trust, and human-AI collaboration. My work integrates human-computer interaction (HCI), AI ethics, and behavioral science to advance AI systems that not only enhance human capabilities but also promote responsible and community-driven innovation.

My research aligns closely with the mission of [Good Systems](https://goodsystems.utexas.edu/), where I examine the unintended consequences of AI deployment, ensuring that AI systems are designed for societal benefit while mitigating potential risks. In addition, I am also engaged with the **Cosmic AI Institute**, where I explore how trustworthy, interpretable AI methods can support scientific discovery in astronomy. I am particularly interested in AI’s role in broadening access to scientific knowledge through open-source tools, data sharing, and educational initiatives.

I bring a strong interdisciplinary background that blends machine learning, human-computer interaction, and human behavioural dynamics. I completed my PhD at [Penn State’s College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Mary Beth Rosson](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/mur13). I was also an active member of the Innovation and Collaboration Lab(https://cil.ist.psu.edu/) led by [Dr. Jack M. Carroll](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/jmc56) and Dr. Rosson. Currently, I am collaborating with [Dr. Matthew Lease](https://mattlease.com/) in my fellowship work.
